Meta Interview Sucked: Got Rejected After Onsite
Man, this Meta interview was a total shitshow that had me doubting everything. I applied for a Software Engineer job at Meta (Facebook) early 2025 through their website, feeling pumped with my background – CS degree from a good school, two years at a mid-sized tech place building web apps, and some personal projects like a social media app clone. Got a referral from a buddy there, thought that'd help.

Started with an online coding test: three problems on HackerRank, easy stuff like arrays to medium graphs. Nailed it, submitted fast, felt good. Two weeks later, recruiter calls – phone screen set up. Guy was nice, talked about my resume, projects, why Meta. Then coding: longest substring without repeats. Used sliding window, explained it well, handled weird cases. Thought it rocked, but they said 'we'll see.'

Weeks go by, then onsite invite to Menlo Park. Super excited, flew out, hotel, prepped hard – system design, behavioral, whiteboard practice. Day comes: six interviews, 45 mins each, back-to-back.

First: Coding with senior. LRU cache. Coded in Python, hashmap and linked list, O(1) ops. He liked it, asked about threads.

Second: System design. Instagram feed. High level: users, posts, follows. Load balancers, servers, sharded DBs, NoSQL, Redis cache, Kafka queues. Talked scale, consistency, trade-offs. Intense af.

Third: Behavioral. 'Tough teammate story.' Told one from last job, how I fixed it. 'Why Meta?' Their world-connecting mission.

Fourth: Coding. N-Queens. Backtracking, pruning, clean code. Time complexity chat.

Fifth: Lunch with three engineers. Hobbies, work style, contributions. They talked ads, AI moderation. Felt real, but maybe not.

Sixth: Hiring manager. Career goals, leadership, culture fit. Failures and lessons.

Left wiped out but hopeful. Campus cool – free eats, gym, coffee. Two weeks later, rejection: 'Thanks, but no.' Crushed me. Thought I killed it, but design maybe weak, or fit off. Meta's bar is crazy high, want perfection. Learned a ton on design and interviews. Gonna try again in six months with more exp. This sucked, but grew from it.
